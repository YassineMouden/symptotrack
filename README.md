## Application Structure

SymptoTrack follows a 5-step process to guide users through symptom tracking and analysis:

1. **Info**: Collection of basic user information (age, sex)
2. **Symptoms**: Interactive selection of symptoms using a body model or search
3. **Conditions**: AI-generated potential conditions based on reported symptoms
4. **Details**: Additional targeted questions based on potential conditions
5. **Treatment**: Treatment recommendations and next steps

## Core Components

### Interactive Body Model

The application uses a visual body model allowing users to click on different body parts to select symptoms. This provides an intuitive way to specify symptom locations without medical terminology.

### AI Symptom Analysis

SymptoTrack uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to analyze reported symptoms and generate potential matching conditions with confidence scores. This analysis includes:

- Condition descriptions and symptom matching
- Potential severity assessment
- Treatment approaches
- When to see a doctor recommendations

### Treatment Recommendations

For each potential condition, the application provides:

- Categorized treatment options (medications, lifestyle changes, procedures)
- Medical resource finder to locate healthcare providers
- Shareable treatment reports
